Currently testing with various destination counts to ensure smooth transitions between different grid layouts.\n</info added on 2025-06-27T02:51:02.575Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-27T02:52:09.131Z>\nI've completed the grid logic implementation with several enhancements beyond the initial requirements. The getGridClass() function now properly handles all destination count scenarios with appropriate Tailwind classes. I also implemented smart destination selection logic that prioritizes selectedDestinations when available, with fallback to currentDestination when needed.\n\nThe Hero section now features dynamic content that adapts to selection context:\n- For multiple destinations: Title shows \"X Destinations\" and description combines destination names\n- For single destination: Title displays the specific destination name\n- Trip duration calculation now intelligently shows the maximum duration for multi-destination trips\n\nAll content transitions are now smooth with appropriate duration settings (transition-all duration-300/500), ensuring a polished user experience when destinations change. The grid layout successfully adapts across all viewport sizes while maintaining visual consistency.\n</info added on 2025-06-27T02:52:09.131Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-27T04:37:44.179Z>\nI've completed the grid logic implementation with significant animation enhancements. The core animation system now features:\n\n- Corrected `useDestinations` → `useDestination` import from DestinationContext with proper null handling\n- Optimized animation timing (250ms instead of 700ms) with premium cubic-bezier easing\n- GPU-accelerated transformations using `will-change: transform`\n- Sophisticated neighbor influence system where adjacent destinations scale to 0.95x when one is hovered\n- Elastic expansion effect (2.2x) with subtle overshoot for a premium feel\n- Smart hover zones that trigger 1.1x pre-expansion when cursor approaches within 30% threshold\n- Enhanced visual effects including elastic glow animation and smooth color transitions\n\nThe technical implementation includes specialized functions like `getNeighborScale()` for cinematic breathing effects and `getExpansionFactor()` with elastic overshoot calculations. Mouse movement tracking with distance calculations enables the approach detection system.\n\nAll animations are now significantly more responsive at 250ms with professional cubic-bezier easing, creating a sophisticated, fluid experience that feels premium and engaging. The implementation is fully TypeScript compliant with proper null handling and type safety throughout.\n</info added on 2025-06-27T04:37:44.179Z>",
