## 🎯 Current Focus

### **Task 6: Dynamic Hero Section**
**Status**: 5/5 subtasks effective completion (100% COMPLETE!) 🎉
**Major Milestone**: Premium cinematic hero with combined expansion and depth-of-field blur effect.

**✅ FINAL IMPLEMENTATION:**
- **Hover Expansion**: Focused slice expands to 60% width.
- **Depth-of-Field**: Other slices shrink, blur (4px), and dim (brightness 0.7).
- **Fluid Animation**: Smooth `350ms` cubic-bezier transitions.
- **Robust Visuals**: Uses `object-position` for accurate image slicing, preventing scrambling.
- **Immediate Response**: Hover effects trigger instantly with no delay.

### **🎉 TASK 6 COMPLETE: CINEMATIC HERO VIEWPORT**

**Animation System Excellence:**
- ✅ Combined width expansion and blur effect for a premium, engaging feel.
- ✅ GPU-accelerated transitions for smooth 60fps performance.
- ✅ Correctly displays "slices" of a single large image for each destination.
- ✅ Replaced dimming with a more effective `blur` and `brightness` combination.
- ✅ Removed all complex state management and timeouts for a simpler, more robust implementation.

## 🎯 **Immediate Next Steps**
1. ✅ Update memory bank with Task 6 completion.
2. ✅ Mark Task 6 as complete in Task Master.
3. ✅ Commit and push to dev branch.
4. 🎯 Begin Task 7: Implement Smart Content Generation System.

**Project Status**: TASK 6 COMPLETE - Major milestone achieved! ✅

## 🎨 **Visual Design Context**

### ✅ **Cinematic Hero Design System**
- **Layout**: A horizontal "film strip" of destinations that fills the container.
- **Interaction**: On hover, one slice expands smoothly while others shrink and blur.
- **Effects**: `filter: blur(4px) brightness(0.7)` on non-hovered items.
- **Sizing**: Hovered item takes `60%` width, others share the remaining `40%`.
- **Animation**: `350ms` duration with `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`.

## 📂 **Key Files Status**

### ✅ **Task 6 Implementation Files**
- `web/src/components/Hero.tsx` - Fully refactored with the new animation logic.
- `web/src/components/DestinationDropdown.tsx` - Unchanged, but interacts with Hero.
- `web/src/contexts/DestinationContext.tsx` - Unchanged, provides data to Hero.

## 🚀 **Development Status**

### ✅ **Task 6 Final Achievement**
- **Cinematic Experience**: The hero is now visually stunning and highly interactive.
- **Performance**: Animations are smooth and responsive.
- **Code Quality**: Refactored to be simpler, more robust, and easier to maintain.

### 🎯 **Next Development Phase**
1. **Task 7**: Implement Smart Content Generation System.
2. **Task 8**: Destination Detail Views
3. **Task 9**: Implement Search Widget with Destination Awareness

### 📈 **Progress Tracking**
- **Completed**: 6/15 tasks (40% complete) - Major milestone achieved!
- **Current Status**: Premium cinematic hero animation system.
- **Deployment**: Ready to be deployed to dev/staging.
- **Technical Foundation**: Solid architecture with advanced multi-destination support.
